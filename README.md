Welcome to MacTool! Before using MacTool, please read this guide, with important notices:

Do not install or repeatedly boot up the MacTool EXE. Frequent booting can lead to errors or even permanent damage. Always wait for the tool to fully shut down before attempting to start it again.
Avoid altering or deleting any files within the MacTool directory. Changing these files can compromise the functionality of the tool.
If you need to make adjustments, ensure you back up the original files before making any changes. This allows you to restore the tool to its original state if something goes wrong.
Renaming any component of MacTool may disrupt its operation. Stick to the original naming conventions to ensure proper functionality.
Only download updates from the official MacTool discord or authorized sources. Unauthorized updates may contain bugs or malicious software that can harm your tool or whole computer.
Always use MacTool according to the guidelines provided in this manual. If you encounter issues, refer to the troubleshooting section before making any changes.
If you experience errors, try rebooting only once and allow the tool to reset completely. If problems persist, consult the staff instead of attempting fixes yourself.
